# Real-Time Inventory Management System

## Introduction
This project is a **Real-Time Inventory Management System** designed to track and update inventory levels for businesses in real time. It includes role-based access for **Admins** and **Employees**, providing features like inventory tracking, stock movement analysis, and low-stock alerts. The system is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

  npm install
  ```

- For the frontend:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following:
  ```env
  MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
  PORT=5000
  SOCKET_PORT=5001
  ```

#### 4. Start the Application

- Start the backend server:
  ```bash
  cd backend
